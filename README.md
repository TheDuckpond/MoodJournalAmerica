# Mood Journal America
#### The Birthplace of Patriotic Data Science

*Mood Journal America* is an exploratory project comprised of ugly data and questionable statistical models.

We are interested in conveying the story that is America the best we can, and the techniques to enable us to do so.

In short, we’re kind of like a psychiatrist’s notebook if America sat down to chat.

## Current Status
As of 01 August 2014, we are just beggining to upload some code and finish preparing the site for all the world to see.

## Things We Use
*An incomplete list...*

* Most of our visualizations utilize the beautiful [d3js](http://d3js.org/) library.

* Our backend uses both [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/) and [Redis](http://redis.io/)
 

* We use [Apache](https://httpd.apache.org/) and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/2.3.2/) for the website, with additional stylings from [Journal](http://bootswatch.com/journal/). 

* Any and all pieces of adapted code are directly accompanied by a reference to the original author

* An incomplete list of our growing data sources can be found [here](http://duckpond.wesleyan.edu/america-journal/data/)
